## Introduction

The Titanic dataset provides information on the passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not, their age, class, fare, and other attributes. By performing EDA on this dataset, we can uncover patterns and relationships within the data that can inform further analyses and model building.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Statistical summary of the dataset.
- Visualizations to explore relationships between features.
- Insights and observations derived from the analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-dataset-eda.git
    cd titanic-dataset-eda
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Titanic_Dataset_EDA.ipynb
    ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to perform the exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset.
